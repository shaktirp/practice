Heap sort
Typical tree, sorting and string questions.

==== Sums ====
Given two words and a dictionary, print the path from one word to the next changing one letter at a time

Merge Intervals.

for encoding that {a,b,c,...,z}<->{1,2,3,...,26}
if given a list of digit e.g. [1,2,3], this may represent {1,2,3}->{a,b,c} or {12,3}->{l,c} or {1,23}->{a,w}. so there are 3 possible interpretations for list [1,2,3]
so, given a list of digit, calculate the number of possible interpretations for the list.

Given an absolute path for a file (Unix-style), simplify it.
For example,
path = "/home/", => "/home"
path = "/a/./b/../../c/", => "/c"

3. Note: Copied this question from Glassdoor. I was asked the same question.
You have an unsorted array of integers and a function........string getCategory(integer)........which deterministically returns 1 of three possible strings: "low", "medium", or "high", depending on the input integer. You need to output an array with all the "low" numbers at the bottom, all the "medium" numbers in the middle, and all the "high" numbers at the top. This is basically a partial sort. Within each category, the order of the numbers does not matter...For example, you might be give the array [5,7,2,9,1,14,12,10,5,3]. For input integers 1 - 3, getCategory(integer) returns "low", for 4 - 10 it returns "medium," and for 11 - 15 it returns "high". You could output an array (or modify the given array) that looks like this: [3,1,2,5,5,9,7,10,14,12]
